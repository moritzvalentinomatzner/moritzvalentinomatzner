Hi there. I am Moritz Valentino ðŸŒ¸ 

I work as a <span style="color:red">data journalist</span> I am very much interested in the <span style="color:blue">political economy of data</span> and how data (science) can be used to <span style="color:green">uncover structural inequalities and discriminations</span>.

Some stories I published this year that I am proud of include 
- **Berlin's Missing Teachers**. Berlin has an educational crisis. But are all students affected equally? I scraped data for all public schools in Berlin and showed how the lack of teachers overproportionally affetcs poor neighbourhoods. We created an (interactive map)[https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/berliner-klassenfrage-hier-gibt-es-am-meisten-unterrichtsausfall-datenanalyse-und-interakive-karte/) and a (narrative piece)[https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/ohne-reserve-eine-berliner-schulleiterin-kaempft-mit-dem-lehrermangel/]. 
- **Kita Notstand**. Germany has an educational crisis (ii). Over 380.000 spots in pre-school education are missing. We created a survey for parents and educators and analzed more than 2.000 responses. You can find the longread (here)[https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/bildung/2023/11/14/kitanotstand-wie-das-system-versagt-personalmangel-erzieher/].
- **Demo Atlas**. We analyzed years and years of data on all demonstrations that took place in Berlin. We first (mapped the data)[https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/demo-atlas-berlin-wofuer-wird-in-meiner-nachbarschaft-demonstriert/] and as well conducted an (analysis of the topics people demostrated for / against)[https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/demo-analyse-berlin-wofuer-gehen-die-leute-auf-die-strasse/].

Before turning to journalism I worked as a reasearcher at the Free University of Berlin and taught a class on (Critical Data Science)[https://moritzvalentinomatzner.shinyapps.io/kdst/].
